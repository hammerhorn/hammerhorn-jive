;W[pg]C[Burress: That formation was looser than I normally play it, there may have been more tactis there
Burress: I think we pursue two different strategies, you cap my moves a lot, and I try to play inside a lot.  I eventually start panicking at the prospect of an enormous moyo.  I still haven't figured out how to play comeptively for that area (the center).
]
;B[pi]C[chrishorn: what do you mean by inside
Burress: Underneath I mean
Burress: I don't think I have ever tried a capping attack for central control like you do.
chrishorn: i see
]
;W[ph]C[Burress: I was scared of r 12 there.  I was wondering if that might kill that group
]
;B[qh]C[chrishorn: i was scared of it to.  i thought my group would be endangered :)
]
;W[pj]
;B[qj]C[chrishorn: i was afraid of you cutting.  but i guess i had more liberties eh?
]
;W[oi]C[Burress: I think you would kill me before I could make a threat.  I have 2 liberties after that moveand I think you can keep attacking

chrishorn: i wonder if we should register
Burress: At kisiedo?
chrishorn: yeah
chrishorn: youre the only person i ever play with
Burress: Same here
Burress: We could get experience and ratings
chrishorn: i d/l ed some ai's to play against, but its more fun playing a human
Burress: HOw good are the ai's?
chrishorn: very good
Burress: Like can they beat strong players, like professionals?
chrishorn: i don't know.  but they are hard as fuck for me....
chrishorn: i have used gnugo mostly
chrishorn: with drago gui
chrishorn: i believe there is a 9x9 program called igowin
Burress: I was just wondering how far they have progressed, since a chess computer has beaten a reigning world champion (sort of, highly suspicious behavior implicates the computer had help)
chrishorn: help?
