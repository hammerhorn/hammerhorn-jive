Burress: That happens in chess too, sometimes it goes on for minutes and minutes]

Burress: Yeah it was an interesting balance of moyos until I snuck in on that lower left group
chrishorn: yes
Burress: You were able to capture more northern territory in exchange, but that my group started to creep and grab a lot of space
chrishorn: yeah])
